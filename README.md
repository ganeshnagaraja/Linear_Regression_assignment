# Prediction of demand for shared bikes using MLR


## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

    Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 


## Technologies Used
Scikit-learn

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Statsmodels

## Conclusion
Upon analysing the data, it was observed that the linear regression model was able to predict the bike demand fairly accurately with an R2 score 0.7963
